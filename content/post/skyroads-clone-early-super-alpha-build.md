Hello, I've been working a little more on my spare time on the game. This build still has some bugs but it's playable
I think, so there you go:

- [Windows 64-bit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vxs0wnecti4ett2/tns.zip?dl=0)

Once the game gets more complete, I will eventually add builds to other platforms.

Notes:

- The game doesn't have a name yet, so ignore the TAIHO thing in the intro.
- The ship model is temporary, it doesn't fit well with the environment, I still don't know what to do here.
- If you have Java installed and you are not on Windows, you can download from the link above and run the **.jar** in the folder.

Thank you :)
