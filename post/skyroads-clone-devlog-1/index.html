<p>It&rsquo;s christmas evening and I&rsquo;m here writing my first devlog. I decided to do these because I think I can keep better track of my progress and it&rsquo;s also nice to share ideas, it might come to be useful for someone someday.</p>

<p>So, I want to talk about a game I have been working on for about 3 months now, which is much more time than I ever did work on a game.
As you can tell by the title of this post, it&rsquo;s a Skyroads clone/remake, if you don&rsquo;t know what game Skyroads is, you should definitely look up, it&rsquo;s
a pretty fun game from the good old DOS times. Originally made by Bluemoon Interactive, Skyroads is a remake itself from an older game from the same
developer called Kosmonaut, it&rsquo;s one of that games that is &ldquo;easy to learn, hard to master&rdquo; with the gameplay being pretty much you guiding a
space ship while having to jump some blocks in space, simple right? Well, I advise you to confirm that by yourself ;)</p>

<p>My version of Skyroads is pretty faithful to the original, I only made it prettier and will possibly add some more features in the future, but I really
need to focus on getting the gameplay solid right now.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing the game using <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a>, which is a Java framework for cross-platform games,
It&rsquo;s the framework/library that I am most familiar with, so I&rsquo;m feeling pretty confortable with the development.</p>

<p>I will also use Blender for modeling the ship&rsquo;s 3D model, every model until now has been hard-coded into the game.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-game-looks-like-now">How the game looks like now</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written too much and showed you nothing, so here it goes:</p>

<small>No roads for Andromeda :c</small></p>

<p>&ldquo;Taiho&rdquo; is just a temporary name that I don&rsquo;t even remember what it means. I still haven&rsquo;t come up with a final name, so I&rsquo;m accepting suggestions.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-code-looks-like-now">How the code looks like now</h3>

<p>Well, not great, in fact, pretty ugly. I actually started writing this game more than half a year ago, but gave up after 1 month, and then I started working on it
again in the middle of November, and my coding style has changed a lot in that short period of time, lots of bad design choices like functions receiving arguments that it
shouldn&rsquo;t even know it exists, separation of concerns, general code organization, etc&hellip; I wish I had started writing this as an engine and only after I had a working engine
I should start writing the game itself, but no, everything is mixed up and you can see gameplay code together with physics simulation. Can I fix that? Of course. Will I fix that? mmm, probably not.
I just have this feeling that I need to &ldquo;ship the product&rdquo; as fast as possible because it has been so much time since I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;finished&rdquo; a game (last was in June 2015) that I need to prove to myself
that I&rsquo;m able to finish this as quick as possible. After that, I will start working on a new game from scratch, and focus on writing a proper game engine first.</p>

<h3 id="todos">TODOs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Finish the gameplay mechanics (tile effects, etc&hellip;), I&rsquo;m almost done here.</li>
<li>Make a proper 3d model for the ship, I still want it to be pretty basic, but anything is better than the fucking rectangle that it is now.</li>
<li>Make a level editor, editing level files by hand is pretty boring right now, maybe I&rsquo;ll polish it enough that I will leave it there for players who want to build their own levels.</li>
<li>Make more worlds, there is only &ldquo;Red Heat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Andromeda&rdquo; at the moment, need to come up with some A E S T H E T I C S for the rest, I plan to have 6 worlds, each with 3 roads.</li>
<li>Support for controllers.</li>
<li>Optimize the renderer post-processing pipeline, I’m already mentally preparing myself for this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully it will be done by March 2017.</p>

<h3 id="open-source">Open source</h3>

<p>The game is not open-source at the moment, I think it hasn&rsquo;t reached a level where it might be useful for anyone yet, specially for the grotesque mistakes that I&rsquo;ve made.
But I will make it open-source in the future, I just hate when small games like this are not open-source, as ugly as the code maybe, they are still a great source of learning
for people who want to get into game development and see how that particular game was made.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>So that is it, this is the project I&rsquo;ve been working on to practice game development, if you liked it, stay tuned for more devlogs. ;)</p>

<p>And also, merry christmas.</p>
